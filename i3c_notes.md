**Note :** MD file is common for both i3c_master and i3c_slave EP.

# Introduction #
 
The sample code accompanying this file shows the operation of the I3C Driver on Renesas RA2E2/RA4E2/RA6E2 MCUs based on Renesas FSP.  
The I3C master on EK-RA2E2/EK-RA4E2/EK-RA6E2 demonstrates operations associated with an I3C slave running on another RA2E2/RA4E2/RA6E2 board. Once initialization is successful,
I3C Master device assigns slave address to I3C slave device through DAA (dynamic address assignment) using I3C common command code (CCC).  
Once Dynamic Address Assignment is completed, the Master EP performs write/read operations, and displays slave device information based on user input. 
If the on-board switch is pressed on the slave side, it will initiate an IBI transfer request.
The application status messages will be displayed in the Jlink RTT Viewer and on-board LEDs. Refer **[LED Status](#led-status)** section for LED observation.

## Verifying operation ##
1. Import, generate and build both i3c_master and i3c_slave EPs in different workspaces.
   Before running the example project, make sure hardware connections are done on both master and slave side.
2. Download i3c_master EP to one EK-RA2E2/EK-RA4E2/EK-RA6E2 kit and run the project.
3. Download i3c_slave EP to another EK-RA2E2/EK-RA4E2/EK-RA6E2 kit and run the project.
4. Now open one Jlink RTT Viewer and connect to the master board and open another/second JlinkRTTViewer and connect it to slave board.
5. User can perform Menu option operations on the master side and check corresponding results for the Master and Slave EPs on the respective JlinkRTTViewer.
6. Also on slave side user can perform IBI transfer request using Push button(S2) and verify result on JLinkRTT_Viewer.
